<strong>Before proceeding with the upgrade of an existing environment, ensure that you have carefully read the <a href="#versionUpgrade">Version upgrade</a> section</strong>.</fieldset>
<h2>
<a name="Perspectives"></a>Perspectives</h2>
<p> The new <em>Perspectives</em> feature offers users a simplified interface without having to request specific development or integration into an enterprise portal. A perspective includes a hierarchical menu to access relevant entities and services related to the user&#39;s activity.</p><p>Perspectives can be easily configured under the &#39;Administration&#39; area. Several perspectives can be configured for different business lines within the company - or for a group of users with specific activities.</p><p>The existing user interface, now called &#39;Advanced perspective&#39;, remains available, but it is now possible to limit its access.</p><p>Perspectives can be configured in <em>Administration &gt; Perspectives</em>.</p><p><img alt="/5.6.0-Perspectives.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-Perspectives.png"></img></p><p>See the <a href="../user_introduction/gui.html">User interface documentation</a>, <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#perspective">Perspectives configuration</a> and <a href="../references/ui_services.html#integration">Integration of UI services with workflows or perspectives</a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="userInterface"></a>User interface improvements</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id3s1"></a>Combo-box selector</h3>
<p>When defining a foreign key, a new feature now allows accessing an advanced selection view through the &#39;Selector&#39; button.</p><p><img alt="/5.6.0-AdvancedSelection.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-AdvancedSelection.png"></img></p><p>If this property has been defined, a selection button will be displayed at the bottom right corner of the drop-down list. The &#39;Selector&#39; button opens the advanced selection view from where sorting and searching options can be used. This selection view must have been previously configured in the data model and can be hierarchical or tabular.</p><p>See the <a href="../user_datamodel/userdatamodel_elementproperties.html#Combobox_selector">Combo-box selector</a> for more information.</p><div class="ebx_noteDiv">
<h5 class="ebx_noteTitle">
<b>Note</b></h5>
<p class="ebx_note">The drop-down list design has also been lightened by removing the first line which displayed the current value of the foreign key field.</p></div>
<h3>
<a name="id3s2"></a>New preview icon</h3>
<p>A new preview icon<img alt="/5.6.0-NewIcon.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-NewIcon.png"></img> has been introduced and replaces the previous version<img alt="/5.6.0-OldIcon.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-OldIcon.png"></img>. It has a thinner border and lightens the pages. </p><h3>
<a name="id3s3"></a>Manage preferred views</h3>
<p>The &#39;View&#39; menu has been slightly reorganized: </p><ul>
<li><p>A new &#39;Manage preferred views&#39; action has been added, replacing the former &#39;Set as default view&#39; (see below).</p></li><li><p>The &#39;Withdraw current view&#39; action has been replaced by &#39;<em>[Default view]</em>&#39; in the &#39;Views&#39; sub-menu (the default view is directly deduced from the data model definition).</p></li><li><p>The &#39;Reset to default view&#39; action has been replaced by &#39;Return to my preferred view&#39;</p></li></ul>
<p><img alt="/5.6.0-ViewMenu.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-ViewMenu.png"></img></p><p>Only one <em>preferred view</em> (previously called &#39;default view&#39;) by table was available for all users. It is now possible to define preferred views by profile (i.e. by role and/or by user).</p><div class="ebx_noteDiv">
<h5 class="ebx_noteTitle">
<b>Note</b></h5>
<p class="ebx_note">The &#39;Manage preferred views&#39; feature is only available to the data set owners.</p></div>
<p>See <a href="../user_data/userdata_viewing.html#preferred_views">Manage recommended views</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s4"></a>Menu on non-target hierarchy nodes</h3>
<p>If a hierarchy node refers to a table record, a button to run UI services on it is now available, even if the record does not belong to the target table of the hierarchy.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s5"></a>Associations in the record creation form</h3>
<p>Associations are now displayed in the record creation forms thanks to a configurable parameter located in the &#39;Ergonomics and layout&#39; section of the &#39;Administration&#39; area. By default, it is set to not displayed. When in creation mode, a standard label is displayed instead of the associated objects view since the record is not yet created. </p><p>See <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#ergoBehavior">Ergonomics and layout</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s6"></a>Tolerant XML import for extra elements</h3>
<p>Configuration parameters have been added to the XML import wizard and to the interface configuration in <em>Administration &gt; User interface &gt; Graphical interface configuration &gt; Default option values &gt; Import/Export &gt; Ignore extra columns</em>. Those parameters allow users running imports that will ignore the elements presents in the XML document to be imported, but that not are not (or no longer) defined in the data model.</p><h2>
<a name="Datamodeling"></a>Data modeling</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id4s1"></a>Default view of groups</h3>
<p>It is now possible to specify that a group outside a table must be collapsed or expanded by default in the user interface. </p><p><img alt="/5.6.0-DefaultViewGroup.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-DefaultViewGroup.png"></img></p><p>See <a href="../user_datamodel/userdatamodel_elementproperties.html#AdvancedPropertiesFields">Advanced properties for fields</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id4s2"></a>Set multiple triggers</h3>
<p>In the data modeling assistant, it is now possible to set several triggers on fields and tables.</p><p>See <a href="../models/constraints.html#triggers">Triggers</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id4s3"></a>Length constraint when creating fields</h3>
<p>It is now possible to specify a length constraint directly when creating a field in a mapped table (tables in relational data models, historized tables and replicated tables). As a length constraint is mandatory in mapped tables, this facilitates the definition of these tables. </p><h3>
<a name="id4s4"></a>Hidden field in search panes</h3>
<p>In previous versions, it was possible from the data model to set a field as hidden in the search, but this restriction only applied to &#39;Text search&#39;. This data model property has been enriched to offer more flexible options. </p><p><img alt="/5.6.0-HiddenInSearches.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.6.0-HiddenInSearches.png"></img></p><p> In the data model assistant, this property is accessed under <em>Advanced properties &gt; Default view</em>. See <a href="../models/access_properties_categories.html#defaultViewHiddenInSearch">Hiding a field in search tools</a> for more information. </p><h3>
<a name="id4s5"></a>Field excluded from the apply last modifications service</h3>
<p>It is now possible to specify that a field must be excluded from the service that allows applying the last modifications performed on a record to other records of the same table. This can be done by using the new XML Schema attribute <code>osd:applyLastModification=&quot;ignored&quot;</code>. </p><p>See <a href="../models/access_properties_categories.html#applyLastModification">Apply last modifications policy</a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="Dataworkflow"></a>Data workflows</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id5s1"></a>Significant performance improvements</h3>
<p>Accessing the work items inbox and other workflow entries is now smoother and faster thanks to a set of enhancements detailed below. </p><h3>
<a name="id5s2"></a>New global permissions</h3>
<p>In order to improve workflow performances, new global permissions have been created. The workflow navigation pane display now depends on these new global permissions. </p><p>For example, if a user is allowed to display &#39;Workflow launchers&#39;, the &#39;Workflow launchers&#39; entry will always be displayed in the navigation pane - even if no launcher is available. On the contrary, if a user is not allowed to display &#39;Workflow launchers&#39;, the entry &#39;Workflow launchers&#39; will never be displayed in the navigation pane - even if launchers are available for this user. </p><p>See <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#globalPermissions">Global permissions</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id5s3"></a>Workflow permissions</h3>
<h4>
Simplification</h4>
<p>In order to improve workflow performances, workflow permissions have been simplified.</p><p>A user with any workflow permission (excluding the &#39;launch&#39; and &#39;view completed workflow&#39; permissions) is now systematically allowed to visualize workflows.</p><p>Permissions now directly determine which records are to be displayed in the workflows table. The records state is only evaluated to determine which action buttons are displayed.</p><p>See <a href="#BackwardCompatibility">Backward compatibility</a> for impacts.</p><p>See <a href="../user_workflowmodel/userworkflowmodel_actions.html#permissions">Permissions on associated data workflows</a> for detailed information on workflow permissions.</p><p> See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ProcessExecutionContext.WorkflowPermission.html"><code>ProcessExecutionContext.WorkflowPermission</code></a> in Java API for more information. </p><h4>
Display only launched workflows</h4>
<p>A new option is available in the configuration of permissions enabling to restrict the access of a workflow creator: if enabled, the creator of a workflow will only visualize the workflows he launched (and associated work items) in the &#39;Monitoring active workflows&#39;, &#39;Monitoring work items&#39;, and &#39;Completed workflows&#39; sections. If a user is a workflow creator but has the permission to visualize workflows, this restriction is not applied.</p><p>See <a href="../user_workflowmodel/userworkflowmodel_actions.html#permissions">Permissions on associated data workflows</a> for detailed information on workflow permissions.</p><h4>
Cleaned workflow permission API</h4>
<p>The interface <code>ActionPermissionsOnWorkflowContext</code> has been cleaned to use <code>ProcessExecutionContext</code> methods. Some methods have been set as deprecated and others have been added: it is now possible to get the profile associated to each <code>WorkflowPermission</code> in the user interface, to use them in the programmatic action permissions. It is necessary to specify use cases and default behaviors for other cases.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ActionPermissionsOnWorkflowContext.html"><code>ActionPermissionsOnWorkflowContext</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id5s4"></a>New email notification for a user task</h3>
<p>When a work item is offered to a role, all members of the role can take and start the work item. A notification can be sent to the members of the role when the work item is offered to them.</p><p>A new notification &#39;Offered work item allocated to another user&#39; has been added to notify the members of the role when the work item is taken by or allocated to another user. In this way, they get real time notifications when a work item is no longer available.</p><p>This notification can be set in the &#39;Notification&#39; section of a user task in the workflow model.</p><h3>
<a name="id5s5"></a>Notification frequency for a work item deadline</h3>
<p>When the deadline of a work item has been reached, a notification email can be sent to the concerned users. By default, this email is sent every day until the work item is completed. It is now possible to change the frequency of notifications thanks to the &#39;Notification frequency&#39; parameter in the user task definition under the &#39;Deadline&#39; tab. This parameter defines the number of days between each email notification after the deadline has been reached. This allows reducing the frequency of deadline notifications.</p><h3>
<a name="id5s6"></a>HTML email with the MailSpec API</h3>
<p>A new method has been added to specify the content type of an email.</p><p>Two content types are available: &#39;text/plain&#39; (default content type) and &#39;text/html&#39;.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/MailSpec.html#setContentType(com.orchestranetworks.workflow.MailSpec.ContentType)"><code>MailSpec.setContentType</code></a> and <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/MailSpec.ContentType.html"><code>MailSpec.ContentType</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id5s7"></a>Enhanced process instance step API</h3>
<p>A new method has been added to get the step identifier.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ProcessInstanceStep.html#getId()"><code>ProcessInstanceStep.getId</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id5s8"></a>Enhanced work item API </h3>
<p>This new method gives the possibility to know if the deadline of a current work item has been reached. </p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/UserTask.WorkItem.html#hasReachedDeadline()"><code>UserTask.WorkItem.hasReachedDeadline</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="techAdmin"></a>Technical administration</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id6s1"></a>Direct WSDL download</h3>
<p>It is now possible to download the data services WSDL from an EBX5 server using HTTP(S).</p><p>See <a href="../references/dataservices_wsdl.html#buildFromWSDLConnector">WSDL download using a HTTP request</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s2"></a>Log procedure starts</h3>
<p>It is now possible to log a procedure execution start.</p><p>See <a href="../installation/properties.html#ebx.logs.logProcedureStart">Log procedure starts</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s3"></a>Log validation starts</h3>
<p>It is now possible to log a data set validation start.</p><p>See <a href="../installation/properties.html#ebx.logs.logValidationStart">Log validation starts</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s4"></a>Log data set validation</h3>
<p>The log category <code>ebx.log4j.category.log.validation</code> has been created to log the details of data sets validation in a specific output. In prior versions, data sets validation details were logged in the category <code>ebx.log4j.category.log.setup</code>. Consequently, the category <code>ebx.log4j.category.log.setup</code> will no longer contain the data sets validation details if the new category <code>ebx.log4j.category.log.validation</code> has been specified in the <code>ebx.properties</code> file. </p><p>See <a href="../installation/properties.html#ebxLog">Configuring the EBX5 logs</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s5"></a>Event broker</h3>
<p>Used for activity monitoring and statistics purposes, this new feature and its management console are integrated into EBX5. Only available for administrators. The feature supervision relies on the API which can only be used from the add-ons, where implementation should be located inside EBX5 modules.</p><p>See <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#eventBroker">Event broker</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s6"></a>Task scheduler</h3>
<p>A task execution can now be launched on demand.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s7"></a>User session termination</h3>
<p>It is now possible to select several active sessions for <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#sessions">termination</a>. Go to <em>Administration &gt; Actions &gt; User sessions</em>.</p><h3>
<a name="d3"></a>Distributed data delivery (D3) improvements</h3>
<h4>
Master node supervision</h4>
<p>The console manager now displays, for each registered slave, the TCP ports used for sending archives.</p><h4>
Slave nodes delivery data space management</h4>
<p>A new wizard provides extra flexibility for:</p><ul>
<li><p>slave node multi-selection</p></li><li><p>delivery data space deletion</p></li><li><p>slave node unregistration</p></li></ul>
<p>See <a href="../engine/d3_admin.html#D3ServicesOnMaster">Services on master nodes</a> for more information.</p><h4>
Slave node performance</h4>
<p>Data services are no longer blocked during full resynchronization.</p><p>At the second phase of the two-phase commit process, commit and rollback requests are sent in parallel to all concerned slaves.</p><h3>
<a name="id6s9"></a>History profiles</h3>
<p>The history profiles defined in &#39;lax&#39; mode had exactly the same behavior as the ones in &#39;strict&#39; mode. Hence, in the definition of history profiles, the parameter &#39;Transaction fails if historization is not available&#39; has been removed. Consequently, built-in profiles have been deprecated, and new ones have been added: </p><ul>
<li><p><code>ebx-referenceBranch-strict</code> and <code>ebx-referenceBranch-lax</code> have been deprecated, and <code>ebx-referenceBranch</code> has been created to be used instead.</p></li><li><p><code>ebx-allBranches-strict</code> and <code>ebx-allBranches-lax</code> have been deprecated, and <code>ebx-allBranches</code> has been created to be used instead.</p></li></ul>
<p>This has no impact on historization for data models using deprecated profiles, which already behave according to the &#39;strict&#39; mode.</p><h2>
<a name="Misc"></a>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id7s1"></a>Java API to get session input parameters</h3>
<p>The new method <code>getInputParameterValue</code> allows getting the value of a parameter that has been specified in the initial HTTP request.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/service/Session.html#getInputParameterValue(boolean, java.lang.String)"><code>Session.getInputParameterValue</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s2"></a>Java API to get an archive in the default directory</h3>
<p>The new factory method <code>Archive.forFileInDefaultDirectory</code> allows specifying an archive in the default archives directory. This server directory stores archives that have been exported and imported from the user interface.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/service/Archive.html#forFileInDefaultDirectory(java.lang.String)"><code>Archive.forFileInDefaultDirectory</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s3"></a>Inheritance in CSV exports and imports </h3>
<p>A new option now allows to explicitly export data with additional inheritance information: whether a record is root, overwriting, inherited or occulting; and whether a field value is inherited or not.</p><p>The CSV import supports the same option. It allows taking into account the inheritance modes defined for fields or records during the import, so as to ensure a complete round-trip without information loss.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/service/ExportImportCSVSpec.html#setInheritanceEnabled(boolean)"><code>ExportImportCSVSpec.setInheritanceEnabled</code></a> in Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s4"></a>Configuration of list separators for CSV exports</h3>
<p>In the user interface, it is now possible to configure the list separator to be used when exporting table records to CSV files.</p><p>The configuration is located under <em>Administration &gt; Graphical interface configuration &gt; Default option values &gt; Import/Export</em>. The configuration can be modified locally for each CSV export.</p><p>See <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#graphical">Graphical interface configuration</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s5"></a>Java API to check severe errors</h3>
<p>A new method allows knowing if a data set contains errors that make its content unavailable.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/../Java_API/com/onwbp/adaptation/Adaptation.html#hasSevereError()"><code>Adaptation.hasSevereError</code></a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="Performance"></a>Performance improvements</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id8s1"></a>Indexes</h3>
<p>An optimization of the internal structure of non-primary key indexes improves the performance of mass-deletions. The performance benefit is particularly important on large tables having an indexed field whose distinct values are limited and shared by many records (<a href="#bug_13425">bug #13425</a>). Mass-updates modifying the value of such fields are also much faster.</p><p>Moreover, extra optimizations have been made to minimize the memory usage of all indexes in semantic mode (both primary key and non-primary key indexes). The following memory gains have been observed: </p><ul>
<li><p>a division by 2 for indexes whose field is auto-incremented;</p></li><li><p>a division by 8 for non-discriminant indexes.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="id8s2"></a>Keeping the validation report in memory</h3>
<p>The property <code>ebx.validation.report.keepInMemory</code> has been added to the main configuration file. When activated (by default), it allows the validation report to be kept in memory, regardless of the specified loading strategy of data spaces. </p><p> Retaining the validation report prevents the server from performing multiple validations, which are potentially expensive. However, in rare cases where numerous data spaces have been loaded, retaining many reports could consume large amounts of memory. In such a case, it is recommended to deactivate this property. </p><pre class="ebx_example brush: html">
# Specifies whether the validation report should be kept in memory,
# regardless of the loading strategy of the data space.
# Default value is true. However, it is recommended to deactivate it
# when the repository contains a large number of open data spaces and
# data sets.
#ebx.validation.report.keepInMemory=false

Data workflows entries</h4>
<p>In the &#39;Data workflows&#39; section, all entries (&#39;Inbox&#39;, &#39;Workflow launchers&#39;, &#39;Monitoring&#39;, etc.) are now displayed according to the associated global permissions. Before this evolution, a workflow entry was only displayed if the associated table was not empty.</p><p>In other words, it is now global permissions that determine the workflow entry to be displayed, and not the content of associated tables anymore.</p><p>By default, all new workflow global permissions are enabled for all users.</p><p>Consequently, a user who had no authorization to launch a workflow can now see the &#39;Workflow launchers&#39; entry.

<p>Workflow permissions have been greatly simplified in order to improve workflow performances.</p><p>These simplifications may impact the display of the &#39;Data workflow&#39; section for some users: users may visualize more workflows than they used to.</p><p>Now, all users who can visualize workflows are also able to visualize publications, workflows and work items, regardless of the workflow state (including workflows in error state). Before this simplification, only workflow administrators could visualize workflows in error state.</p><p>Users who can unpublish now automatically have the permission to visualize workflows. Hence, they can visualize all publications, workflows and work items, regardless of the publication state. The publication state only determines if the &#39;unpublish&#39; action button should be displayed. Previously, these users could only visualize disabled publications (and associated workflows and work items). Enabled publications (and associated workflows and work items) were hidden.</p><p>The same evolution applies to the &#39;disable&#39; permission. Now, users who can disable a permission are systematically allowed to visualize all publications, workflows and work items, regardless of the publication state. The publication state only determines if the &#39;disable&#39; action button should be displayed. Previously, these users could only visualize enabled publications (and associated workflows and work items). Disabled publications (and associated workflows and work items) were hidden.</p><p>These simplifications impact the <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow.html"><code>ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow</code></a> API. To know if a user can visualize a workflow, the VIEW permission is evaluated. If the permission is disabled, other permissions are evaluated at the same level (UNPUBLISH, DISABLE, ADMINISTRATE .... and so on). If the user has another permission (excluding the &quot;CREATE_PROCESS&quot; permission), he will have the permission to &quot;VIEW&quot;, regardless of the workflow state.</p><p>See <a href="../user_workflowmodel/userworkflowmodel_actions.html#permissions">Permissions on associated data workflows</a> for detailed information on workflow permissions.</p><p> See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ProcessExecutionContext.WorkflowPermission.html"><code>ProcessExecutionContext.WorkflowPermission</code></a> Java API for more information. </p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow.html"><code>ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow</code></a> Java API for more information.</p><h4>

<a name="id9s2"></a>How to upgrade an installed environment</h3>
<p>In order to upgrade your version of EBX5, perform the following steps:</p><ol>
<li><p>Backup your repository, including the RDBMS and the directory <code>ebx.repository.directory</code>.</p></li><li><p>Replace the <code>*.war</code> and <code>ebx.jar</code> files on your application server.</p></li></ol>
<fieldset class="ebx_attention">
<legend>
<b>Attention</b></legend>
<p>If using EBX5 add-ons, ensure that the versions of the add-ons are compatible with EBX5 version 5.6.0 before upgrading. For the backward compatibility of the add-ons themselves, consult the release note of each add-on.</p><p>Once an EBX5 repository has been used with this version, using it with a previous version is not supported. Consequently, you must create a backup before upgrading, as described above, in order to maintain the possibility of downgrading later.</p></fieldset>
