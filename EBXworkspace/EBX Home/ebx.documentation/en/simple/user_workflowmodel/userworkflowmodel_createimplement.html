<h2>
<a name="creation"></a>Creating a workflow model</h2>
<p>A new workflow model can be created in the <strong>Workflow Models</strong> area. The only required information at creation is a name that is unique in the repository.</p><p>The steps of the workflow model are initialized with a single transition. In order to fully implement the workflow model, you must define the sequence of steps beyond this initial transition.</p><h2>
<a name="step"></a>Implementing the steps</h2>
<p>A workflow model defines steps that correspond to different operations that must be performed on data, and associated conditions. The following types of steps exist:</p><ul>
<li><p>User task</p></li><li><p>Script task</p></li><li><p>Condition</p></li><li><p>Sub-workflow invocation</p></li><li><p>Wait task</p></li></ul>
<p><a name="datacontext"></a>A data context is linked to each data workflow. This data context can be used to define variables that can be used as input and output variables in the steps of the workflow.</p><h3>
<a name="progressStrategy"></a>Progress strategy of the next step</h3>
<p>For each step type (excluding sub-workflows invocations), a property is available to define which progress strategy has to be applied for the next step. Upon step completion, this strategy is evaluated in order to define the navigation when the workflow is executed. By default, the progress strategy is set to &#39;Display the work items table&#39;. In that case, after the step has been executed, the work items table (work items inbox or monitoring &gt; work items) is automatically displayed, in order to select the following work item.</p><p>Another strategy can be selected: &#39;Automatically open the next step&#39;. This strategy allows the user to keep working on this workflow and to directly execute the next step. If, following to this execution, a work item is reached and the connected user can start it, then the work item is automatically opened (if several work items are reached, the first created is opened). Otherwise, the next step progress strategy is evaluated. If no work item has been reached, the work items table will be displayed.</p><p>This strategy is used to execute several steps in a row without going back to the work items inbox.</p><p>In the case of conditions, two other strategies are available: &#39;If true, automatically open the next step&#39; and &#39;If false, automatically open the next step&#39;. These strategies allow choosing which strategy will be applied according to the condition result.</p><p>There are some limitations that will lead to disregard this strategy. In that case, the work items table is automatically displayed. This property will be disregarded when: the next step is a sub-workflow; or the current step is a user task with more than one work item.</p><h2>
<a name="step_user"></a>User tasks</h2>
<p>User tasks are steps that involve actions to be performed by human users. Their labels and descriptions can be localized.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s1"></a>Participants</h3>
<p>The participants of a user task are the profiles that are intended to work on the task.</p><p>By default, without service extensions, a separate work item is created and offered to each specified profile. If a profile refers to a user instead of a role, the work item is directly allocated to that user.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s2"></a>Service</h3>
<p>EBX5 includes the following built-in services that can be used for user tasks:</p><ul>
<li><p>Access a data space</p></li><li><p>Access data (default service)</p></li><li><p>Access the data space merge view</p></li><li><p>Compare contents</p></li><li><p>Create a new record</p></li><li><p>Duplicate a record.</p></li><li><p>Export data to a CSV file</p></li><li><p>Export data to an XML file</p></li><li><p>Import data from a CSV file</p></li><li><p>Import data from an XML file</p></li><li><p>Merge a data space</p></li><li><p>Validate a data space, a snapshot or a data set</p></li></ul>

<h3>
<a name="termination"></a>Configuration</h3>
<h4>
<a name="enableReject"></a>Main options &gt; Enable reject</h4>
<p>By default, only the <em>accept</em> action is offered to the user when saving a decision.</p><p>It is possible to also allow users to reject the work item by setting this field to &#39;Yes&#39;.</p><h4>
<a name="enableConfirmationRequest"></a>Main options &gt; Enable confirmation request</h4>
<p>By default, a confirmation request is displayed after user task execution when the user saves the decision by clicking the &#39;Accept&#39; or &#39;Reject&#39; button.</p><p>To disable this confirmation prompt, set this field to &#39;Yes&#39;.</p><h4>
<a name="commentsRequired"></a>Main options &gt; Comments required</h4>
<p>By default, it is optional to submit a comment associated with a work item.</p><p>It is possible to require the user to enter a comment before saving the decision by setting this field to the desired validation criteria. Comments can be set to be always required, required only if the work item has been accepted, or required only if the work item has been rejected.</p><h4>
<a name="customizedLabels"></a>Main options &gt; Customized labels</h4>
<p>When the user task is run, the user can accept or reject the work item by clicking the corresponding button. In the workflow model, it is possible for a user task to define a customized label and confirmation message for these two buttons. This can be used to adapt the buttons to a more specific context.</p><h4>
Termination &gt; Task termination criteria</h4>
<p>A single user task could be assigned to multiple <em>participants</em> and thus generate multiple work items during workflow execution. When defining a user task in the workflow model, you can select one of the predefined methods for determining whether the user task is finished, based on the statuses of its component work items. When the user task&#39;s exit requirement has been satisfied, the data workflow will move on to the next step defined in its model. </p><p>For example, for the case of a user task where a product record needs to be approved, you could designate three potential participants. The task termination criteria can specify whether the product record needs to be approved by all three users, or only the first user to respond.</p><p>The default user task termination criteria is &#39;When all work items have been accepted.&#39;</p><h4>
<a name="rejectTolerance"></a>Termination &gt; Reject tolerance</h4>
<p>By default, if a user rejects a work item during workflow execution, the user task is placed into an error state and the workflow progress is halted. When the user task is in an error state, a workflow administrator must intervene by replaying the step where the error occurred in order to continue the workflow execution. </p><p>In order to change this default behavior, it is possible to define a certain number of work item rejections to tolerate. While within the limit of tolerated rejections, no error will occur and it is the task termination criteria that determines when to end the user task.</p><p>The following task termination criteria automatically tolerate all rejections:</p><ul>
<li><p>&#39;When all work items have been either accepted or rejected&#39;</p></li><li><p>&#39;Either when all work items have been accepted, or as soon as one work item has been rejected&#39;</p></li></ul>
<h4>
<a name="notification"></a>Notification</h4>
<p>A notification email can be sent to users when specific events occur. For each event, you can specify a content template.</p><p>It is possible to define a monitor profile that will receive all emails that are sent in relation to the user task.</p><div id="seealsoShort">
<p><span style="color:#808080; font-size:1.1em; font-family:'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;  margin:0 4px 0 0;">See also</span><a href="../user_workflowmodel/userworkflowmodel_intro.html#notification">Generic message templates</a></p></div>
<h4>
<a name="reminder"></a>Reminder</h4>
<p>Reminder emails for outstanding offered or allocated work items can be periodically sent to the concerned users. The recipients of the reminder are the users to whom the work item is offered or allocated, as well as the recipients on copy.</p><p>The content of the reminder emails is determined by the current state of the work item. That is, if the work item is offered, the notification will use the &quot;Offered work items&quot; template; if the work item is allocated, the notification will use the &quot;Allocated work items&quot; template.</p><h4>
<a name="deadline"></a>Deadline</h4>
<p>Each user task can have a completion deadline. If this date passes and associated works items are not completed, a notification email is sent to the concerned users. This same notification email will then be sent daily until the task is completed.</p><p>There are two deadline types: </p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Absolute deadline</strong>: A calendar date.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relative deadline</strong>: A duration in hours, days or months. The duration is evaluated based on the reference date, which is the beginning of the user task or the beginning of the workflow. </p></li></ul>
<h2>
<a name="step_script"></a>Script tasks</h2>
<p>Script tasks are automatic tasks that are performed without human user involvement.</p><p>Two types of script tasks exist, which, once defined, can be used in workflow model steps:</p><table class="ebx_definitionList">
<tr class="ebx_definitionListItem">
<td class="ebx_definitionListTerm"><p>Library script task</p></td><td class="ebx_definitionListDefinition"><p>EBX5 includes a number of built-in library script tasks, which can be used as-is.</p></td></tr>
<tr class="ebx_definitionListItem">
<td class="ebx_definitionListTerm"><p>Specific script task</p></td><td class="ebx_definitionListDefinition"><p>Specifies a Java class that performs custom actions. The associated class must belong to the same module as the workflow model. Its labels and descriptions are not displayed dynamically to users in workflow models.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<h3>
<a name="workflow.scriptTask.library"></a>Library script tasks</h3>
<p>EBX5 includes the following built-in library script tasks:</p><ul>
<li><p>Close a data space</p></li><li><p>Create a data space</p></li><li><p>Create a snapshot</p></li><li><p>Import an archive</p></li><li><p>Merge a data space</p></li><li><p>Send an email</p></li></ul>
<div class="ebx_noteDiv">
<h5 class="ebx_noteTitle">
<b>Note</b></h5>
<p class="ebx_note">Some built-in library script tasks are marked as &quot;deprecated&quot; because they are not compatible with internationalization. It is recommended to use the new script tasks that are compatible with internationalization.</p></div>
<h2>
<a name="step_condition"></a>Conditions</h2>
<p>Conditions are decision steps in workflows.</p><table class="ebx_definitionList">
<tr class="ebx_definitionListItem">
<td class="ebx_definitionListTerm"><p>Library condition</p></td><td class="ebx_definitionListDefinition"><p> EBX5 includes a number of built-in library conditions, which can be used as-is.</p></td></tr>
<tr class="ebx_definitionListItem">
<td class="ebx_definitionListTerm"><p>Specific condition</p></td><td class="ebx_definitionListDefinition"><p>Specifies a Java class that implements a custom condition. The associated class must belong to the same module as the workflow model. Its labels and descriptions are not displayed dynamically to users in workflow models. </p></td></tr>
</table>
<h3>
<a name="workflow.condition.library"></a>Library conditions</h3>
<p>EBX5 includes the following built-in library conditions:</p><ul>
<li><p>Data space modified?</p></li><li><p>Data valid?</p></li><li><p>Last user task accepted?</p></li><li><p>Value null of empty?</p></li><li><p>Value equals?</p></li></ul>
<h2>
<a name="subworkflows"></a>Sub-workflow invocations</h2>
<p>Sub-workflow invocation steps in workflow models put the current workflow into a waiting state and invoke one or more workflows.</p><p>It is possible to include another workflow model definition in the current workflow by invoking it alone in a sub-workflow invocation step.</p><p>If multiple sub-workflows are invoked by a single step, they are run concurrently, in parallel. All sub-workflows must be terminated before the original workflow continues onto the next step. The label and description of each sub-workflow can be localized.</p><table class="ebx_definitionList">
<tr class="ebx_definitionListItem">
<td class="ebx_definitionListTerm"><p>Static</p></td><td class="ebx_definitionListDefinition"><p>Defines one or more sub-workflows to be invoked each time the step is reached in a data workflow. For each sub-workflow, it is possible to set its localized labels and descriptions, as well as the input and output variable mappings in its data context.</p><p>This mode is useful when the sub-workflows to be launched and the output mappings are predetermined.</p></td></tr>
<tr class="ebx_definitionListItem">
<td class="ebx_definitionListTerm"><p>Dynamic</p></td><td class="ebx_definitionListDefinition"><p>Specifies a Java class that implements a custom sub-workflow invocation. All workflows that could be potentially invoked as sub-workflows by the code must be declared as dependencies.</p><p>The workflow data context is directly accessible from the Java bean.</p><p>Dynamic sub-workflow invocations must be declared in a <code>module.xml</code> file.</p><p>This mode is useful when the launch of sub-workflows is conditional (for example, if it depends on a data context variable), or when the output mapping depends on the execution of the sub-workflows.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<h2>
<a name="waitTasks"></a>Wait tasks</h2>
<p>Wait task steps in workflow models put the current workflow into a waiting state until a specific event is received.</p><p>When a wait task is reached, the workflow engine generates a unique resume identifier associated with the wait task. This identifier will be required to resume the wait task, and as a consequence the associated workflow.</p><div class="ebx_noteDiv">
<h5 class="ebx_noteTitle">
<b>Note</b></h5>
<p class="ebx_note">The built-in administrator always has the right to resume a workflow.</p></div>
