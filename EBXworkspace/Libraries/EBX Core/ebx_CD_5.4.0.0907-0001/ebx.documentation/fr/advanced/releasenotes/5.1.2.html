<h2>
<a name="new"></a>Workflow evolutions</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id1s1"></a>&quot;My work list&quot; by publication</h3>
<p>In Workflow Data, a new feature is available for visualizing the work items of the current user by publication. &quot;My work list&quot; is displayed when a publication is selected in the general work list. This feature is useful to take or open a work item directly, without selecting it in the general work list.</p><p> For more information, see <a target="_self" href="../user_dataworkflow/userdataworkflow_ui.html">My work list</a>. </p><h3>
<a name="id1s2"></a>Enable confirmation request for decision</h3>
<p>When the user saves his decision after the task execution by clicking on accept or reject button, a confirmation request is displayed. It is now possible to configure this confirmation request</p><p> For more information, see <a target="_self" href="../user_workflowmodel/usertask.html#enableConfirmationRequest">Enable confirmation request</a>. </p><h3>
<a name="id1s3"></a>The script &quot;Create a data space&quot;</h3>
<p> In a workflow model, in the script <code>Create a data space</code> , the new parameter <code>branchNameForPermissionsCopy</code> has been added for the permissions copy. Thanks to this parameter, it is now possible to define from which data space the permissions must be copied for the created data space. If no data space is defined for the copy, the parent data space is used by default. </p><h3>
<a name="id1s4"></a>Work item creation API</h3>
<p>In a service extension, it is now possible to create a work item by specifying both an allocated user and a role for a possible reallocation. The work item is created in the allocated state, but an offered role is saved to make the allocation actions available. </p><p> For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/CreationWorkItemSpec.html">CreationWorkItemSpec</a>. </p><h3>
<a name="id1s5"></a>Programmatic permissions rules</h3>
<p>The workflow permissions have been contextualized and a new method is available to check the resolution context of the programmatic permissions rules (process instance or published process). </p><p> For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow.html">ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow</a>. </p><h3>
<a name="id1s6"></a>Data context API</h3>
<p>A new method is available to check that the specified variable name is defined in the data context.</p><p> For more information, see <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/DataContext.html">DataContext</a>. </p><h3>
<a name="id1s7"></a>Javadoc</h3>
<p>The Javadoc about permissions rules, work item creation and associated contexts has been enriched.</p><h2>
<a name="comparison"></a>Comparisons</h2>
<p>With EBX5, every data comparison specifies whether it is in resolved mode. In previous versions, the resolved mode allowed to take inherited values into account. In this release, it also implies to take into account computed values (<code>osd:function</code>). </p><p> Consequently, comparisons performed by means of the API will now include differences between computed values: this affects the Java API invoked in resolved mode (see class <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/service/comparison/DifferenceHelper.html">DifferenceHelper</a>) and the data service <a target="_self" href="../references/dataservices.html#getChanges">&quot;Get changes&quot; operation</a> (it is always in resolved mode). </p><p>Another evolution is that now, within the user interface, the comparisons are all in resolved mode (previously, this was already the case for records comparison, but not for homes and instances comparisons). </p><h2>
<a name="optims"></a>Optimizations</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id3s1"></a>Archives</h3>
<p>The size of archives has been optimized, when they are exported with a change set and the export enables minimal content mode. In such cases, only records concerned by the change set are exported. </p><h3>
<a name="id3s2"></a>D3</h3>
<p>The data transferred between a master and a slave have been optimized in order to be lighter and transmitted faster.</p><h2>
<a name="id4"></a>Version upgrade</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id4s1"></a>Backward compatibility</h3>
<h4>
Comparisons</h4>
<p>The <a target="_self" href="#comparison">evolutions on comparisons</a> can change the results when a comparison is made with the Java API in resolved mode or by means of the Data Service &quot;Get Service&quot; operation. </p><h4>
Validation rules</h4>
<p> The interpretation of the validation rules has changed in this new version, in order to make their definition easier and more natural. Henceforth, a valid value has to comply with the criteria defined by a validation rule. <strong>This implies that all existing validation rules will become incorrect and must be updated in this way</strong>. That is, the existing validation rule should be converted to their negation for being valid regarding this new interpretation. See <a target="_self" href="../user_datamodel/userdatamodel_elementproperties.html#validationRules">validation rules</a> for more information. </p><h4>
Data model compilation</h4>
<p> The data model compilation process is now stricter when defining a <code>UILabelRenderer</code> or a <code>UILabelRendererForHierarchy</code> on a table definition. At data model compilation time, an error message is now added to the compilation report if the Java class corresponding to a <code>UILabelRenderer</code> or a <code>UILabelRendererForHierarchy</code> cannot be found by the class loader. </p><p> For more information about <code>UILabelRenderer</code> and <code>UILabelRendererForHierarchy</code> ,&nbsp;see <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/ui/UILabelRenderer.html">UILabelRenderer</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/ui/UILabelRendererForHierarchy.html">UILabelRendererForHierarchy</a> .&nbsp;</p><h3>
<a name="id4s2"></a>How to upgrade an installed environment</h3>
<p>In order to upgrade your version of EBX5, perform the following steps:</p><ol>
<li><p>Backup your repository, including the RDBMS and the directory <code>ebx.repository.directory</code>.</p></li><li><p>Replace the <code>*.war</code> and <code>ebx.jar</code> files on your application server.</p></li></ol>
<h2>
<a name="bugfix"></a>Bug Fixes</h2>
<h3>
<a name="bug-CoreCache"></a>Core Cache</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4149]</strong> On branch purge, the already purged branches should be deleted from the branches and versions technical table. </p><p>If a branch has been purged from the database but is still present in the technical table, the branch purge throws an exception.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4276]</strong> An error occurs when closing or re-opening a branch with a pipe char in the identifier. </p><p>If a branch is created with a pipe char in the identifier, when closing or re-opening this branch, a <code>NullPointerException</code> occurs.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4289]</strong> Error on Oracle if the database tables are not owned by the EBX applicative user. </p><p>On some customer configurations, the instruction &#39;SELECT 1 FROM USER_TABLES&#39; used by EBX to retrieve database tables will fail to see the existing tables (this is the case if a table exists, not in the current user schema, but through the declaration of a synonym).</p></li><li><p><strong>[4298]</strong> Cannot create an instance, due to manual DDL scripts for repository creation being incomplete. </p><p>The DDL scripts provided with EBX build 5.1.x did not include all the required updates. This causes the following error when creating any instance:&nbsp;Invalid object name &#39;EBX_XS&#39;.</p><p>This happens only if the scripts are run manually.</p><p>Workaround: let EBX5 automatically install its tables.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4299]</strong> In relational mode, changing primary key definition leads to an erroneous behavior. </p><p>For a data model in relational mode, if the primary key definition is changed after the first publication, no error message is returned but the change is not correctly taken into account by the database.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4345]</strong> Fatal error appears when entering values out of range [&#39;-2147483648&#39;;&nbsp;&#39;2147483647&#39;]. </p><p>A fatal error is displayed to the user when a custom views filter is applied if a value is out of range [&#39;-2147483648&#39;;&nbsp;&#39;2147483647&#39;] in its defintion</p></li><li><p><strong>[4362]</strong><code>SchemaNode.getNode()</code> can throw <code>NullPointerException</code>. </p><p>In some case <code>SchemaNode.getNode()</code> can throw <code>NullPointerException</code> instead of returning <code>null</code> if no node exists at path.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-DataModeling"></a>Data Modeling</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4221]</strong> A erroneous data model can be published. </p><p>A data model with an erroneous validation rule can be published. The result is a severe error on the resulting data model, and the relative contents become unavailable.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4231]</strong> Data model import from a module cannot load the associated Java classes. </p><p>A data model import from an existing module cannot load the associated Java resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4233]</strong> Validation rules editor crashes on non-table record nodes. </p><p>The validation rules editor is available on non-table record nodes (&quot;instance nodes&quot;), which is fine. However, editing the rules causes the assistant to crash (blank assistant screen and stack-trace in logs).</p></li><li><p><strong>[4234]</strong> In the computation rule editor, the wizard cannot help on non-table record nodes. </p><p>The computation rule editor is available on non-table record nodes (&quot;instance nodes&quot;), which is fine. However, the rules edition wizard cannot retrieve the other nodes to help in the rule design.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4263]</strong> Specific error message on &#39;exclude segment&#39; constraint is ignored at model publication. </p><p>When a specific error message is defined in an &#39;exclude segment&#39; constraint, a wrong element is generated at publication time in the target schema. Then, the specific error message is ignored in an associated data set.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4310]</strong> Severity of a table validation rule is not set correctly when reverse-engineering a model. </p><p>When a user imports an XSD model from the service &quot;Import an existing data model&quot;, the severity of the validation rule is not set correctly.</p><p>For example, if we have &quot;warning&quot; severity in the XSD file, after import it is defined &quot;error&quot;.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-DataServices"></a>Data Services</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4113]</strong> Auto-incremented fields should not be mandatory for the insert. </p><p>In the WSDL, for the insert operation, the auto-incremented fields should not be mandatory, even if they are present in the XSD schema.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4187]</strong> The label is not always optional in version creation data services. </p><p>An exception occurs when executing the data service for version creation, when the label of the version is not defined whereas the description and the locale are defined. The service should be able to create a version without a label but with a description.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4323]</strong> Unable to set a complex terminal node to <code>null</code>. </p><p>There is no way to set a complex terminal node to <code>null</code> through web services. The assignment <code>xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot;</code>, which works on a simple terminal node, does not work here.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4327]</strong> No option &#39;delta mode&#39; exists in the generated WSDL files for update. </p><p>The option delta mode, which guarantees the backward compatibility with V4,is not available in data services.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4328]</strong> Non mandatory complex elements are not declared as nillable in WSDL. </p><p>In order to allow the use of <code>xsi:nil</code> value, a non mandatory complex element must declare the attribute <code>nillable=&quot;true&quot;</code>.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-Documentation"></a>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4111]</strong> Web component: the URLs specified in the documentation are no longer valid. </p><p>The documentation refers to services which have been moved.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-Hierarchies"></a>Hierarchies</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4027]</strong> List field nodes should not be proposed at hierarchy label configuration. </p><p>If the node is not a simple node with <code>maxOccurs=1</code>, the hierarchy configuration crashes. Multi-occurrenced field nodes should not be proposed at hierarchy label configuration.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4117]</strong> In a hierarchy where node ordering is based on the join table dependency link, there may be duplicate child nodes. </p><p>Since version 5.0.3, if a hierarchy dependency link is based on</p><p>a join table, it is possible to configure as an ordering column,</p><p>a column node from the join table instead of a column node from</p><p>the target table.</p><p>In this case, we may found duplicate nodes in the hierarchy displayed.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4247]</strong> Join records linked to a deleted hierarchy member are not deleted. </p><p>When deleting a hierarchy member with children linked by a join table, the join records are not deleted.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4305]</strong> An exception occurs while computing the level of a hierarchy tree. </p><p>If the data space referenced in a join table has been purged and</p><p>no validation has been done to detect it, an exception is thrown.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-ImportExport"></a>Import Export</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4057]</strong> The order of exported columns is erroneous when exporting a table view via standard CSV export. </p><p>The order of exported columns via standard CSV export is the order of the columns in the definition of the specific table view. It should be the order of the columns in the data model instead (this issue appears when the order in the data model is modified).</p></li><li><p><strong>[4094]</strong> When importing a csv file, a field starting with the field delimiter character is not properly imported. </p><p>When importing a csv file, if a field starts with the field delimiter character, this one is omitted. For example, the quote char results in an empty field after import.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4098]</strong> A CSV file with UNIX line separators cannot be imported with the default import settings. </p><p>A CSV file with UNIX line separators cannot be imported, as the line separators are not correctly detected. Explicit UNIX line separator can be programmatically set, but it is too technical an approach.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[3572]</strong> Unexpected behavior when a record that has been occulted or overwritten in a child data set is deleted. </p><p>This issue applies to records that have been occulted or overwritten in a child data set.</p><p>If the record is deleted, then when accessing the occulted or overwritten version in the child data set, the following behavior is observed:</p><p>- If the record has been overwritten: the only fields holding a value are the primary key field(s) and the ones that have been overwritten. The other ones appear as &quot;not defined&quot;.</p><p>- If the record has been occulted: the only fields holding a value are the primary key field(s), all the other ones appear as &quot;not defined&quot;. The &quot;Inherit from parent DataSet&quot; button still appears, and triggers an exception whenever clicked on.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4294]</strong> Values set in a trigger are not shown after form submission. </p><p>When the user submits a form for record creation, and the form includes a field whose value is set by the method <code>TableTrigger.handleAfterCreate</code>, then this value is not visible at first. The user has to click on the <code>Revert</code> button or refresh the page to see it.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-UserInterface"></a>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[3755]</strong> A pre-set value is not defined if the field is read-only. </p><p>A value which is pre-set from an <code>osd:select</code> or a hierarchy is not set if the field is read-only.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4101]</strong> Optimize the management of obsolete HTTP sessions. </p><p>If many sub-sessions are created under the same HTTP session (for example, when viewing records involved in a merge), it is possible to invalidate a still-used root session.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4172]</strong> The display of the comparison of two users in directory data set is erroneous. </p><p>The display of the comparison of two users in directory data set is erroneous. The first column is compacted to the left and the GUI tries to display an encrypted password.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4175]</strong> Record duplicate service is available even if the table is read-only. </p><p>If the primary key of the table is an auto-increment, the <code>duplicate record</code> service is available even if the table has been defined as read-only in data set permissions.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4178]</strong> Wrong behavior for integer input field when entering an out of range value [&#39;-2147483648&#39; ; &#39;2147483647&#39;]. </p><p>For integer fields, if the user fills in an out of range value [&#39;-2147483648&#39;;&nbsp;&#39;2147483647&#39;], he won&#39;t be able to select or edit this record anymore in spite of the fact that the value is accepted by EBX5.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4225]</strong> Cannot select a record in hierarchy view, if not in first page. </p><p>In the hierarchy view, in a target page distinct from the first one: when the user wants to see the detail of a record, the following error message is returned: &quot;The element to be selected has not been found.&quot;</p></li><li><p><strong>[4230]</strong> Filter button is too much on the right (firefox) / action button not align with object (chrome). </p><p>In custom view creation in search criteria wizard filter button is too much on the right. It is also out of its frame.</p><p>In dma action button can&#39;t align if expend/ collapse is used (must refresh to solve).</p></li><li><p><strong>[4245]</strong> Data Spaces selector triggers NullPointerException. </p><p>If the user has no preferred data space (last working data space), and access right to reference is forbidden, opening the data space selector throws a NullPointerException.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4268]</strong> An exception occurs when creating a new record in a filtered table view. </p><p>When accessing the table view filtered via an XPath request in the URI such as &quot;/root/table[field=&#39;toto&#39;]&quot;, if a ValueFunction is defined on the field, an exception occurs when accessing the creation view.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4274]</strong> With the computation rule editor, it is impossible to add a criterion under a logical block. </p><p>In the Data Model Assistant, when using the computation rule editor, it is impossible to add a criterion under a logical block. The criterion creation pop-up gets opened but the button &quot;Add&quot; has no effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4275]</strong> In the computation rules editor, &quot;If true&quot; and &quot;If false&quot; are never deleted. </p><p>In the computation rules editor, &quot;If true&quot; and &quot;If false&quot; are not deleted along with the corresponding condition predicate.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4303]</strong> When navigating through pages, page numbers are no longer displayed if the &quot;last page&quot; button is used. </p><p>In the table view or hierarchy view, if the user clicks on the &quot;last page&quot; button, then the first record number and the total size are no longer displayed.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4307]</strong> A fatal error occurs when applying a tabular view. </p><p>A fatal error occurs when applying a tabular custom view.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4324]</strong> In a newly created data space, the form does not display the updated values after a first submit. </p><p>In a newly created data space, when users modify a record in an existing table and click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button, then the form displays the old values instead of the updated ones. Clicking on &quot;Revert&quot; displays the correct values, though.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4336]</strong> Error when adding &quot;Do not match any criteria&quot; and &quot;Do not match one of criteria&quot; in Custom view. </p><p>The system displays a fatal error when adding twice &quot;Do not match any criteria&quot; or &quot;Do not match one of criteria&quot; in Custom view.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4337]</strong> Error Deletion in some tables. </p><p>It is possible to create a record with special characters in some tables, but not to delete that record.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4338]</strong> With IE6, wrong-sized interface checkbox in data space restriction for relational datamodel. </p><p>The system displays too large a checkbox for data space restriction in relational datamodel</p></li><li><p><strong>[4339]</strong> Wrong redirection when cancelling a CSV export that has been launched from a hierarchy. </p><p>The cancel of a CSV export launched from a hierarchy drives the user to the content of the record instead of the hierarchy.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4342]</strong> Refreshing schemas causes an invalid request. </p><p>When viewing the validation report of a schema in the administration section: asking for a refresh of schemas causes an invalid request error message.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4343]</strong> The services <code>expand all</code> and <code>collapse all</code> are unavailable on the root node. </p><p>When there is no other service on a given node, the services <code>expand all</code> and <code>collapse all</code> are unavailable. As a side effect, these services are unavailable in Data modeling and Workflow modeling.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-UsersPermissions"></a>Users &amp; Permissions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4079]</strong> When the administrator has lost his built-in Role &quot;Administrator&quot;, it cannot be recovered. </p><p>Even with the property <code>ebx.directory.factory=com.orchestranetworks.service.directory.DirectoryDefaultRecoverFactory</code>, the administration rights cannot be recovered as described in the documentation &quot;Administration Guide &gt; Technical administration &gt; Users and roles directory &gt; Default directory &gt; Administrator recovery procedure&quot;.</p></li><li><p><strong>[4288]</strong> The dynamic permissions on workflow are not resolved timely, and get evaluated on terminated process instances. </p><p>- If there is no process instance defined under a process publication, the permissions are not resolved and the method &quot;ActionPermissionsOnWorkflow.getActionPermission&quot; is never called.</p><p>- Moreover, some permissions concerning only the publications are resolved for the process instances too.</p><p>- When accessing the workflow tab, the dynamic permissions get evaluated on terminated process instances.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="bug-Validation"></a>Validation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[4217]</strong> Validation rules do not return the expected result. </p><p>A valid value is considered invalid, and conversely.</p></li></ul>
