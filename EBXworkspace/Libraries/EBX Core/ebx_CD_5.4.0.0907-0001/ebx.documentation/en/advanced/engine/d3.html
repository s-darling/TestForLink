<h2>
<a name="id1"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>EBX5 offers the ability to replicate data from one EBX5 instance to several others. By means of the broadcast service, it also provides an additional layer of security and control to the other features of EBX5: it is particularly adapted when data governance requires the highest levels of data consistency, approval and/or capacity of rollback.</p><h3>
<a name="id1s1"></a>Architecture</h3>
<p>A typical D3 installation consists of one master and several slaves. In the master, the Data Steward declares which data spaces must be replicated, and which user profile is allowed to broadcast them to the slaves. The Data Steward also defines delivery profiles, which are groups of one or more data spaces.</p><p>Each slave must define which delivery profile has to be replicated towards it.</p><p align="center"><img alt="/overview.png" src="../resources/images/d3/overview.png"></img></p><h3>
<a name="id1s2"></a>Involvement of third-party systems</h3>
<p>The features of D3 also allow access by third-party systems to data managed in EBX5 through Data Services. Essentially, when a system consumes the data of a delivery data space, the data is transparently redirected to the last Snapshot that has been broadcast. This ensures a more controlled and reliable view of the managed data.</p><p>Third-party systems can either access the master node or a slave node (hence a physical architecture involving a master node and no slave node is also an option).</p><h3>
<a name="id1s3"></a>Protocols</h3>
<p>If JMS is activated, conversation between a master and a slave is based on SOAP over JMS, while archive transfer between a master and a slave is based on JMS binary messages.</p><p>If JMS is not activated, conversation between a master and a slave is based on SOAP over HTTP, while archive transfer (binary) between a master and a slave is based on TCP sockets.</p><div id="seealsoShort">

<h2>
<a name="id2"></a>Glossary</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id2s1"></a>Broadcast</h3>
<p>The action broadcast is a way to &quot;publish an official snapshot&quot; of data. Underneath, it transparently and transactionally ensures that it is replicated to the slave nodes and becomes &quot;the official truth&quot; for all repositories (master and slaves).</p><h3>
<a name="id2s2"></a>Delivery data space</h3>
<p>A delivery data space is a data space which can be broadcast to authenticated and allowed users, using a dedicated service.</p><p>By default, when a data service accesses a delivery data space (on any node), it is redirected to the last snapshot that has been broadcast. More information in the <a target="_self" href="../engine/d3_broadcast.html#dataServices">Data Services</a> section.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s3"></a>Delivery profile</h3>
<p>A delivery profile is a logical name that groups one or several delivery data spaces. The slaves subscribe to one or several delivery profiles.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s4"></a>Cluster delivery mode</h3>
<p>Synchronization with subscribed slave nodes is performed in a two-phase commit transactional process. This delivery mode is designed to respond to a high volume of queries using load balancing and/or fault tolerance. It ensures the consistency of data in the cluster between slave nodes and their master delivery data spaces. Master and slave nodes use the same committed snapshots.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s5"></a>Federation delivery mode</h3>
<p>Synchronization is performed in a single phase, and with each registered slave node independently. This delivery mode is designed to be used with geographically distributed and/or heterogeneous architectures where response time and network availability cannot be guaranteed. At any one time, slaves can be at different committed snapshot versions. The synchronization processes are thus independent of one another and replay individual slave nodes are performed for certain broadcast failures.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s6"></a>Master node</h3>
<p>The master node is an instance of EBX5 that can define one or several delivery data spaces, and to which slave nodes can subscribe. Otherwise, the master node can also act as a regular EBX5 server.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s7"></a>Slave node</h3>
<p>A slave node is an instance of EBX5 attached to a master node, in order to receive delivery data spaces replication. Except for update restrictions on the delivery/replicated data spaces, the slave node acts as a regular EBX5 server.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s8"></a>Hub node</h3>
<p>A hub node is an instance of EBX5 acting as a master node and as a slave node.</p><h2>
<a name="id3"></a>Known limitations</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id3s1"></a>General limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Each slave node must have only one master.</p></li><li><p>Embedded data models cannot be used in D3 data spaces. Therefore, it is not possible to create a data set based on a publication in a D3 data space.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="id3s2"></a>Broadcast and delivery data space limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Access rights on data spaces are not replicated (whereas access rights on data sets are).</p></li><li><p>Data space information is not replicated.</p></li><li><p>If a data space and its parent are replicated, this parent-child relationship will be lost in the slaves.</p></li><li><p>If a data space is deleted from the master, it remains on the slaves.</p></li><li><p>Re-broadcasting a snapshot where inherited data sets have been added or removed is not supported.</p></li><li><p>Once a snapshot has been broadcast to a slave, subsequent broadcasts of <em>any</em> snapshot with the same name will result in restoring the originally broadcast version of that same name on the slave. That is, if the original snapshot on the master is purged and a new one is created with the same name and subsequently broadcast, then the content of the slave will be restored to that of the previously broadcast snapshot, and not the latest one of the same name.</p></li><li><p>The data model on which the broadcast contents are based must be the same between the broadcast and the current version.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="id3s3"></a>Administration limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical data spaces cannot be replicated, thus the EBX5 default user directory cannot be synchronized through D3.</p></li></ul>
