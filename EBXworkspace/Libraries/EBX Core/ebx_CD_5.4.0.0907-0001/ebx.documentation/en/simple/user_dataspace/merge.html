Merging a data space</h1>
<p>When the work in a given data space is complete, you can perform a one-way merge of the data space back into the data space from which it was created. The merge process is as follows:</p><ol>
<li><p>Both the parent and child data spaces are locked to all users. The locks remain for the duration of the merge operation. This means their contents can be read, but they cannot be modified in any way.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This restriction on the parent data space means that, in addition to blocking direct modifications, other child data spaces may not be merged until the merge in progress is finished.</p></li><li><p>Changes that were made in the child data space since its creation are integrated into its parent data space.</p></li><li><p>The child data space is closed.</p></li><li><p>The parent data space is unlocked.</p></li></ol>

<h2>
<a name="merge"></a>Initiating a merge</h2>
<p>To merge a data space into its parent data space:</p><ol>
<li><p>Select that data space in the navigation pane of the Data Spaces area.</p></li><li><p>In the workspace pane, select <strong>Merge data space</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu.</p></li></ol>
<h2>
<a name="id2"></a>Reviewing and accepting changes</h2>
<p>After initiating a data space merge, you must review the changes that have been made in the child (source) data space since its creation, to decide which of those changes to apply to the parent (target) data space.</p><p>The change acceptance process uses a side-by-side comparison interface that recapitulates the changes that require review. Two <em>change set</em> columns are obtained by taking the relevant changes from the following data space state comparisons:</p><ul>
<li><p>The current child data space compared to its initial snapshot.</p></li><li><p>The parent data space compared to the initial snapshot of the child data space.</p></li></ul>
<p>By default, all detected changes are selected to be merged. You may deselect any changes that you want to omit from the merge. You can view the changes relevant to different scopes in your data model by selecting elements in the navigation pane.</p><p>The merge process also handles modifications to permissions on tables in the data space. As with other changes, access control changes must be reviewed for inclusion in the merge.</p><p>When you have decided which changes to merge for a given scope, you must click the button <strong>Mark difference(s) as reviewed</strong> to indicate that you have reviewed all the changes in that scope. All changes must be reviewed in order to proceed with the merge.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s1"></a>Types of modifications</h3>
<p>The merge process considers the following changes as modifications to be reviewed:</p><ul>
<li><p>Record and data set creations</p></li><li><p>Any changes to existing data</p></li><li><p>Record, data set, or value deletions</p></li><li><p>Any changes to table permissions</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="id2s2"></a>Types of conflicts</h3>
<p>This review interface also shows conflicts that have been detected. Conflicts may arise when the same scope contains modifications in both the source and target data spaces.</p><p>Conflicts are categorized as follows:</p><ul>
<li><p>A record or a data set creation conflict</p></li><li><p>An entity modification conflict</p></li><li><p>A record or data set deletion conflict</p></li><li><p>All other conflicts</p></li></ul>
<h2>
<a name="mergepolicy"></a>Finalizing a merge</h2>
<p>Once you have reviewed all changes and decided which to include in the merge result, click on the <strong>Merge &gt;&gt;</strong> button in the navigation pane.</p><p>Depending on the child merge policy that is configured on the parent data space in your merge, the subsequent process may differ. By default, merges are finalized even if the result would contain validation errors. The administrator of the parent data space in your merge can set its child merge policy so that merges of its children are only finalized if the result would not contain any validation errors.</p><p>If the child merge policy of the parent data space in your merge is the default policy, the merge is carried out regardless of whether there are validation errors in the resulting data space.</p><p>If, however, the administrator of the parent data space has set its child merge policy to &#39;Pre-validating merge&#39;, a dedicated data space is first created to hold the result of the merge. When the result is valid, this dedicated data space containing the merge result is automatically merged into the parent data space, and no further action is required.</p><p>In the case where validation errors are detected in the dedicated merge data space, you only have access to the original parent data space and the data space containing the merge result, named &quot;[merge] &lt;<em>name of child data space</em>&gt;&quot;. The following options are available to you from the <strong>Actions &gt; Merge in progress</strong> menu in the workspace pane:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Cancel</strong>, which abandons the merge and recuperates the child data space in its pre-merge state.</p></li><li><p><strong>Continue</strong>, which you can use to reattempt the merge after you have made the necessary corrections to the dedicated merge data space.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="setmergepolicy"></a>Setting the child merge policy of a data space</h3>
<p>As the administrator of a data space, you can block the finalization of merges of its child data spaces through the user interface when the merges would result in a data space with validation errors. To do so, select <strong>Actions &gt; Information</strong> from the workspace of the parent data space. On the data space&#39;s information page, set the <strong> Child merge policy</strong> to <strong>Pre-validating merge</strong>. This policy will then applied to the merges of all child data spaces into this parent data space.</p><fieldset class="ebx_note">
<legend>
<b>Note</b></legend>
In web component mode, the behavior of the child merge policy is the same as described; the policy defined in the parent data space is automatically applied when merging a child data space. However, this setting is ignored during programmatic merge, which includes script tasks in data workflows.</fieldset>

<h2>
<a name="id4"></a>Abandoning a merge</h2>
<p>Merges are performed in the context of a user session, and must be completed in a single operation. If you decide not to proceed with a merge that you have initiated, you can click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button to abandon the operation.</p><p>If you navigate to another page after initiating a merge, the merge will be abandoned, but the locks on the parent and child data spaces will remain until you unlock them in the Data Spaces area.</p><p>You may unlock a data space by selecting that data space in the navigation pane, and clicking on the <strong>Unlock</strong> button in the workspace. Performing the unlock from the child data space unlocks both the child and parent data spaces. Performing the unlock from the parent data space only unlocks the parent data space, thus you need to unlock the child data space separately.</p><p class="noPrint" align="right"><em><img alt="/ebx_search.png" src="../resources/images/symbols/ebx_search.png"></img> User guide <a target="_self" href="../table_contents_user.html"> table of contents</a></em></p><div id="ebx_breadcrumbBottom">
