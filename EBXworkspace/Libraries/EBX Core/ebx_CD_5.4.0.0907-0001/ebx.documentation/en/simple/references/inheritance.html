<h2>
<a name="id1"></a>Overview</h2>
<p> The main idea behind inheritance is to mutualize resources that are shared by multiple contexts or entities. EBX5 offers several mechanisms for defining, factorizing and resolving data values: <em>data set inheritance</em> and <em>inherited fields</em></p><h3>
<a name="dataSetInheritanceOverview"></a>Data set inheritance</h3>
<p> Data set inheritance is particularly useful when data has to be specialized to various global enterprise contexts, like subsidiaries or business partners. </p><p> Based on a hierarchy of data sets, it allows you to factorize common data on the root data set (or on intermediate ones) and to specialize specific data to specific contexts. </p><p>Data set inheritance mechanisms are detailed in the <a target="_self" href="#dataSetInheritance">section below</a> .&nbsp;</p><h3>
<a name="id1s2"></a>Inherited fields</h3>
<p> As opposed to data set inheritance (which exploits a global built-in relationship between data sets), inherited fields are able to exploit finer-grained dependencies that are specific to the data structure. It allows you to factorize and specialize data at the business entities-level. </p><p>For example, if the model specifies that a Product is associated with a FamilyOfProducts, it is possible that some attributes of Product inherit their value from attributes defined in its associated family.</p><p>Note: It is not possible to use both attribute inheritance and data set inheritance for a same data set.</p><h2>
<a name="dataSetInheritance"></a>Data set inheritance</h2>
<p> As described above, data set inheritance is based on a hierarchy of data set, the <em>data set tree</em>. This section&#39;s purpose is to precisely define data set inheritance mechanisms.</p><h3>
<a name="dataSetInheritanceValues"></a>Lookup mechanism for values</h3>
<p>Formally speaking, the data set inheritance lookup mechanism for values is as follows:</p><ol>
<li><p> if the value is locally defined, returns it</p></li><li><p>otherwise, looks up the first locally defined value according to the built-in child-to-parent relationship of data set in the hierarchy tree</p></li><li><p> if no locally defined value is found, the default value is returned</p><p><code>null</code> is returned if no default value is defined</p><p>Note: default values cannot be defined on:</p><ul>
<li><p>a single primary key node</p></li><li><p>auto-incremented nodes</p></li><li><p>nodes defining a computed value.</p></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<h3>
<a name="dataSetInheritanceRecords"></a>Lookup mechanism for records</h3>
<p> Like values, table records can also be inherited as a whole by multiple contexts, but they can also be partially redefined (<em>overwritten</em>), be specific to a context (<em>root mode</em>) or even be occulted. More formally speaking, a table record has one of four distinct definition modes: </p><ul>
<li><p>A <em>root record</em> is locally defined in the table and has no parent. This means that no record with the same primary key exists in the parent table, or that this parent is an occulting record. </p></li><li><p>An <em>overwriting record</em> is locally defined in the table and has a parent record. This means that a record with the same primary key exists in the parent table, and that this parent is not an occulting record. The overwriting record inherits its values from its parent, except for the values that it explicitly redefines.</p></li><li><p>An <em>inherited record</em> has a parent record but is not locally defined in the current table. All values are inherited.</p></li><li><p>An <em>occulting record</em> specifies that if a parent with same primary key is defined, this parent will not be seen in table descendants.</p></li></ul>
<h2>
<a name="ina"></a>Inherited fields</h2>
<p>The specific inheritance mechanism allows the fetching of the value of a node according to its relationship to other tables.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s1"></a>Lookup mechanism for value</h3>
<p>The lookup mechanism for inherited fields values is the following:</p><ol>
<li><p> If the value is locally defined, returns it.</p></li><li><p> Otherwise, looks up the source record and value to inherit from, according to the properties that are defined in the data model. </p></li><li><p>The process is recursive, if the source node does not locally define a value, it is further looked up, according to the inheritance behavior of the source node.</p></li></ol>
<h2>
<a name="optimize"></a>Optimize &amp; Refactor</h2>
<p>EBX5 provides a built-in UI service for optimizing data set inheritance in your data set tree. This service performs the following functions:</p><ul>
<li><p><em>Handle duplicated values:</em> this procedure detects and removes all parameter values that are duplicates of the inherited value. </p></li><li><p><em>Mutualize common values:</em> this procedure detects and mutualizes the common values among the descendants of a common ancestor.</p></li></ul>
<h3>
<a name="id4s1"></a>Procedure details</h3>
<p>Data sets are processed from the bottom up, which means that if the service is run on the data set at level <em>N</em>, with <em>N+1</em> being the level of its children and <em>N+2</em> being the level of its children&#39;s children, the service will first process the data sets at level <em>N+2</em> to determine if they can be optimized with respect to the data sets at level <em>N+1</em>. Next, it would proceed with an optimization of level <em>N+1</em> against level <em>N</em>.</p><fieldset class="ebx_note">
<legend>
<b>Note</b></legend>
<ul>
<li><p>These optimization and refactoring functions do not handle default values that are declared in the data model.</p></li><li><p>The highest level considered during the optimization procedure is always the data set on which the service is run. This means that optimization and refactoring is not performed between the target data set and its own parent.</p></li><li><p>Table optimization is done for records with the same primary key.</p></li><li><p>Inherited fields are not optimized.</p></li><li><p><em>Optimization and refactoring functions do not modify the resolved view of a data set if it is activated.</em></p></li></ul>
</fieldset>
<h3>
<a name="id4s2"></a>Service availability</h3>
<p>The &#39;Optimize &amp; Refactor&#39; service is available on data sets that have child data sets and also have the property &#39;Activated&#39; set to &#39;No&#39; in its data set information.</p><p>The service is available to any profile with write access on current data set values. It can be disabled by setting a restrictive access right on a profile.</p><fieldset class="ebx_note">
<legend>
<b>Note</b></legend>
For performance reasons, access rights are not verified on every node and table record.</fieldset>
