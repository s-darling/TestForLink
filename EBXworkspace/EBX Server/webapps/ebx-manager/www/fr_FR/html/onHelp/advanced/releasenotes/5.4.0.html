<h2>
<a name="id1"></a>Overview of 5.4.0</h2>
<p><strong><em>This version includes all performance improvements, bug fixes and new features from version <a href="./5.3.2.html">5.3.2</a>.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Due to the automatic upgrade of the product, there may be a one-time performance hit when starting the server with this version for the first time.</em></strong></p><p>This version brings significant updates to EBX5. Notable new features include:</p><ul>
<li><p>A complete refresh of the user interface look and feel to improve usability.</p></li><li><p>High customizability of color themes and form submission button labels for total integration into client environments.</p></li><li><p>&quot;SQL Connect&quot; - Enables automatic data replication to databases accessible to SQL queries.</p></li><li><p>D3 federated mode for asynchronous broadcasting and automatic retries upon failure.</p></li></ul>
<p>Additionally, significant performance gains have been made, notably for data space and snapshot creation.</p><fieldset class="ebx_attention">
<legend>
<b>Attention</b></legend>
<strong>Before proceeding with the upgrade of an existing environment, ensure that you have carefully read the <a href="#versionUpgrade">Version upgrade</a> section</strong>. </fieldset>
<h2>
<a name="id2"></a>Modernized user interface</h2>
<p>This version includes a major revision to the style of the graphical user interface. These changes bring significant improvements with regard to readability and ease of navigation, allowing users to better focus on meaningful data and their tasks.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s1"></a>Flat design</h3>
<p>The new user interface adopts the principles of &quot;flat design&quot;, by employing a clean and minimalist aesthetic with less intrusive visual elements, including:</p><ol>
<li><p>A simpler, less intrusive header bar, which can be completely minimized when not in use.</p></li><li><p>Flat buttons that still look clickable, but are not highlighted until the user mouses over.</p></li><li><p>Removal of unnecessary icons next to labels.</p></li></ol>
<p><img alt="/5.4.0-NewUI.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.4.0-NewUI.png"></img></p><p>While the visual elements of the interface have a refreshed look, the underlying navigation structure and features remain the same as in previous versions.</p><h3>
<a name="id2s2"></a>Improved customizability for better integration</h3>
<p>The new user interface also facilitates a more complete style integration according to corporate design guidelines by being highly customizable.</p><ul>
<li><p>It is now possible to choose color themes for the interface, including primary and secondary colors, as well as colors for the navigation pane, and several key elements and buttons. See <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#graphical">Graphical interface configuration</a> for more information.</p><p><img alt="/5.4.0-GraphicalUIConfig.png" src="../resources/images/releasenotes/5.4.0-GraphicalUIConfig.png"></img></p></li><li><p>The labels of all form submission buttons are now configurable through the standard administration interface. The default labels of the form buttons have also been changed to &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Save and close&quot; and &quot;Close&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Various components of tabular, hierarchical, and record views can now be hidden using the web component API. The new HTTP parameters <code>viewFeatures</code> and <code>recordFeatures</code> allow hiding elements, such as buttons, the title, record selections, etc. See <a href="../references/manager_component_ref.html#viewFeatures">Layout parameters</a> for more information.</p></li></ul>
<h2>
<a name="id3"></a>Additional user interface evolutions </h2>
<h3>
<a name="id3s1"></a>Improved table search</h3>
<p>The search filter for tabular views has been redesigned to make entering basic search criteria more convenient.</p><p>For example, for foreign key fields or fields populated by an enumeration, the possible values are now proposed to the user. Also, date fields are enhanced with auto-completion.</p><p>By default, the search panel displays a simplified mode with basic search criteria. By switching to the advanced search mode, the user is able to use extended operators and can build nested logic.</p><p>It is now also possible to input text into the validation message filter to find all records with a validation message containing that text.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s2"></a>Removal of unnecessary root elements in the navigation pane</h3>
<p>In the navigation pane of the Data area, the <em>root</em> element and its associated documentation no longer appear if the node does not contain attributes or terminal groups. Previously, such cases unnecessarily occupied space in the interface. If, however, the <em>root</em> element contains attributes or terminal groups, it will appear in the navigation pane as before.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s3"></a>Improved documentation</h3>
<p>The presentation of the PDF version of the product documentation has been improved to better delineate sections and chapters. Also, high-level chapters are now numbered to facilitate navigation of the document in hard copy format.</p><h3>
<a name="formalignment"></a>Optimization of form element alignment</h3>
<p>The alignment of form elements has been improved in order to better guarantee uniform display of form layouts. The styling of forms now uses the CSS property &quot;<code>vertical-align: baseline</code>&quot;, where the <em>baseline</em> is the line upon which most characters &quot;sit&quot;.</p><ol>
<li><p>For generic EBX5 inline elements:</p><ul>
<li><p>Text is vertically aligned on the baseline.</p></li><li><p>Text fields of type string are vertically aligned such that the text they contain are aligned on the baseline.</p></li><li><p>Buttons are vertically aligned such that their label text is aligned on the baseline.</p></li></ul>
</li><li><p>For generic EBX5 block elements (<code>div</code>, <code>fieldset</code>, <code>textarea</code>, <code>list</code>), the element is vertically aligned such that the first inline element it contains is aligned on the baseline.</p><p>For example, complex nodes and lists are aligned according to their first elements.</p></li></ol>
<h3>
<a name="id3s5"></a>Custom layout API: Nested tabbed panes</h3>
<p>It is now possible to embed a pane with tabs within a parent pane, which can itself be a tabbed pane, using the custom layout API.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/ui/form/UIFormPaneWriter.html#includePane(com.orchestranetworks.ui.form.UIFormPane)">UIFormPaneWriter.includePane</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/ui/form/UIFormPaneWithTabs.html#addTab(com.onwbp.base.text.UserMessage, com.orchestranetworks.ui.form.UIFormPane)">UIFormPaneWithTabs.addTab</a> in the Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id3s6"></a>Better user interface security</h3>
<p>An extensive review of the user interface has been performed with regard to cross-site scripting security vulnerabilities to address remaining issues.</p><p>Only users of the data, data spaces, and data workflows areas have been considered to be a potential threat. Users with permissions to access the data modeling and workflow modeling areas are trusted, allowing them to specify descriptions and messages containing HTML formatting (hyperlinks, CSS styles, etc.). However, where HTML formatting is permitted, it remains strongly advised not to use <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p><h2>
<a name="id4"></a>Workflow modeling</h2>
<h3>
<a name="workflow_permissions"></a>New permission for viewing completed workflows</h3>
<p><em>Initially included in 5.4.0 Fix 001.</em></p><p>A new permission option is available to allow a profile to view completed workflows, even if the profile is not allowed to monitor running workflows. This new permission is available in the workflow modeling area, in the advanced configuration of the workflow monitoring permissions.</p><p>In particular, this feature is useful for providing access to the graphical history of completed workflows without having to give access to workflow monitoring, which contains technical information.</p><p>The equivalent permission has been added to the <code>ProcessExecutionContext</code> API. See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/workflow/ProcessExecutionContext.WorkflowPermission.html#VIEW_COMPLETED_WORKFLOW">ProcessExecutionContext.VIEW_COMPLETED_WORKFLOW</a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="id5"></a>Table replication using &quot;SQL Connect&quot;</h2>
<p>A new persistence option has been added to allow replicating data from EBX5 tables to dedicated relational tables. These relational tables thus make master data available to external systems for direct access using SQL requests and views.</p><p>To specify the data to be replicated, data models can define replication units that indicate the tables, and their associated data sets and data spaces, to include.</p><p>There are several refresh modes for controlling the frequency of updates. The mode &#39;onCommit&#39; guarantees synchronization at the transactional level, whereas &#39;onDemand&#39; only replicates upon request. Replica refresh requests can be performed through the user interface, using data services, or through the Java API.</p><p>This new option conforms to the persistence principles already implemented for relational and history mode, namely for the creation of dedicated tables and schema updates in the relational database, performed in an automatic and transparent way during data model compilation.</p><p>See <a href="../references/replication.html#howto">Configuring replication</a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="administrativeDelegation"></a>Administrative delegation</h2>
<p>It is now possible to delegate administrative rights to a non-administrator user.</p><p>See <a href="../engine/admin_frontend.html#administrativeDelegation">Administrative delegation</a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="id7"></a>Distributed data delivery (D3)</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id7s1"></a>New federation delivery mode</h3>
<p>D3 broadcasts were previously based on the notion of using a single distributed transaction to guarantee that all D3 slave nodes remain synchronized. The drawback of this approach was that it did not take into account the scenario where slave nodes are physically located at remote sites and where there was a high probability that not all slaves would be constantly available.</p><p>In order to prevent broadcasts from failing completely in these cases, it is now possible to specify the mode &#39;Federation&#39; for a broadcast profile. In this case, the broadcast for each slave is performed asynchronously and independently of other nodes. In case of a failure to broadcast to a particular slave node, the same broadcast is reattempted for that node only.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s2"></a>Automatic shut down notification for slave node maintenance</h3>
<p>When a registered slave node shuts down, it now notifies the master in order to be removed from the broadcast scope. Upon subsequent start up, the slave node subscribes again.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s3"></a>Improved broadcasting performance</h3>
<p>Broadcast archives are now reused for multiple slaves at the same version. The broadcast is also performed simultaneously for all clustered slaves, then simultaneously for federated slaves. Furthermore, when the master node shuts down, any waiting broadcast requests are persisted so that broadcasting can be resumed when the node is restarted.</p><p>See <a href="../engine/d3_broadcast.html">D3 broadcasts and delivery data spaces</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s4"></a>Slave monitoring</h3>
<p>Load balancers, monitoring applications and other infrastructure tools can now be notified upon slave start ups and shut downs requested at the application server level.</p><p>See <a href="../engine/d3_admin.html#slaveMonitoring">Slave node monitoring through the Java API</a> for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id7s5"></a>D3 API</h3>
<p>The D3 Java API has been extended to include the notion of <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/d3/DeliveryMode.html">delivery modes</a>. A <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/d3/NodeMonitoring.html">slave monitoring interface</a> has also been added, with methods that are triggered whenever a slave&#39;s status changes to &#39;Available&#39; or &#39;Unavailable&#39;.</p><h2>
<a name="javaAPI"></a>Java API</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id8s1"></a>Retrieve the parent of a data set or a record</h3>
<p>A new method has been added to retrieve the parent of a data set or record.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/onwbp/adaptation/Adaptation.html#getParent()">Adaptation.getParent()</a> in the Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id8s2"></a>Omit XML declaration from XML export</h3>
<p>Two new methods have been added for disabling the XML declaration in XML exports.</p><p>See <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/service/ExportSpec.html#isOmitXMLDeclaration()">ExportSpec.isOmitXMLDeclaration()</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/service/ExportSpec.html#setOmitXMLDeclaration(boolean)">ExportSpec.setOmitXMLDeclaration(boolean)</a> in the Java API for more information.</p><h3>
<a name="id8s3"></a>Dynamic data model labels and descriptions</h3>
<p>It is now possible to define dynamic labels and descriptions using a specific Java class. This Java class can programmatically specify labels and descriptions for the elements of the data model. The labels and descriptions defined in this Java class are displayed in associated data sets in preference to the ones defined locally on an element. </p><p>See <a href="../user_datamodel/userdatamodel_configuring.html#configuration">Data model properties</a>, <a href="../models/labels_error_messages.html#dynamicDoc">Dynamic labels and descriptions</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../Java_API/com/orchestranetworks/schema/SchemaDocumentation.html">SchemaDocumentation API</a> for more information.</p><h2>
<a name="id9"></a>Performance improvements</h2>
<p>Several performance improvements have been made, in addition to the ones included in version <a href="../releasenotes/5.3.2.html#DataModeling">5.3.2</a>, namely faster access to views.</p><h3>
<a name="id9s1"></a>Data space and snapshot creation</h3>
<p>Data space and snapshot creation time is up to 80% faster than in previous versions.</p><h3>
<a name="id9s2"></a>Comparison in resolved mode</h3>
<p>Comparisons performed in resolved mode have been improved, in some cases by several orders of magnitude.</p><h3>
<a name="id9s3"></a>Memory and CPU management for data services</h3>
<p>Several optimizations have been introduced for the data service operations &#39;getChangesOnTable&#39; and &#39;getChangesOnDataSet&#39;:</p><ul>
<li><p>Execution has been optimized to consume less memory. The XML message is no longer stored in memory, but rather, is written directly to the response stream.</p></li><li><p>A cache is now used when building the report of changes.</p></li></ul>
<p>See <a href="../references/dataservices_execution.html#getChanges">Get changes operations</a> for more information on these operations.</p><h2>
<a name="versionUpgrade"></a>Version upgrade</h2>
<h3>
<a name="id10s1"></a>Backward compatibility</h3>
<h4>
Browsers no longer supported</h4>
<p>As of version 5.4.0, Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 are no longer supported browsers.</p><p>See <a href="../installation/supported_env.html#browsers">Supported web browsers</a> for more information.</p><h4>
Databases no longer supported</h4>
<p>As of version 5.4.0, the following databases are no longer supported:</p><ul>
<li><p>Oracle Database versions prior to 10g R2</p></li><li><p>Microsoft SQL Server 2005</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.4</p></li></ul>
<p>See <a href="../installation/supported_env.html#databases">Supported databases</a> for more information.</p><h4>
<a name="formalignment_compatibility"></a>Changes in form element alignment</h4>
<p>Due to the improvements related to the <a href="#formalignment">standardization of form element alignment</a>, the behavior of form elements is now different from in previous versions. The styling of forms now uses the CSS property &quot;<code>vertical-align: baseline</code>&quot;, where the <em>baseline</em> is the line upon which most characters &quot;sit&quot;.</p><p>Existing custom user interfaces, such as UI services, UI beans, and <code>formLayout</code>s, may be subject to regressions as a result of these alignment changes. The pages will still be functional, however, misalignment issues may occur. To resolve these issues, it is strongly recommended to use the Java API of the context associated with each interface whenever possible.</p><p>More specifically, the following recommendations apply when building forms using the Java API:</p><ul>
<li><p>When adding form rows using <code>UIResponseContext.startFormRow</code>, surround the set of rows with the methods <code>startTableFormRow</code> and <code>endTableFormRow</code> in order maximize conformance with EBX5 user interface standards.</p><p>Since a pair of <code>startTableFormRow</code> and <code>endTableFormRow</code> calls can only contain rows added using <code>startFormRow</code>, it will not be possible to surround each row with <code>Div</code> elements. If <code>Div</code> elements were included, for example to show and hide entries in a form, the API now has the method <code>UIFormRow.setRowId</code> to assign an HTML identifier to the form row.</p><p>Also, the new method <code>UIResponseContext.newFormRow(Path)</code> can now be used to create a form row in a UI bean that is based on the path of a node.</p></li><li><p>For a block element, apply the CSS display style <code>display: inline-table;</code> to align its first element with the baseline. If that style does not result in the desired layout, <code>vertical-align: text-top;</code> can also be used.</p></li><li><p>In general, minimize the inclusion of specific HTML styles and tags to allow the default styles of EBX5 to apply to custom interfaces. The objective of these latest improvements is to automatically apply a standardized style to all elements on HTML pages, while simplifying the implementation process for the developer.</p></li></ul>

<h4>
Null values displayed by UI beans</h4>
<p>Due to the correction of the <a href="./5.3.2.html#bug_5639">bug 5639</a>, there is a now a backwards compatibility issue for cases where a UI bean displays a <code>null</code> value in a read-only context. Previously, in read-only mode, the method that was called was <code>UIBeanEditor.addForDisplay(UIResponseContext aResponse)</code> for both <code>null</code> and non-<code>null</code> values. As of version 5.3.2, the method <code>UIBeanEditor.addForNull(UIResponseContext aResponse)</code> is now called for <code>null</code> values for both write mode and read-only mode. This may change the way that forms are displayed.</p><h4>
Colors and themes</h4>
<p>In the user interface administration, some parameters have been removed and new ones have been added under the graphical user interface configuration.</p><p>For example, the application logo no longer requires an image position value, and the image provides must now have a height of 40 pixels. The width of the logo automatically determines the position of buttons in the header.</p><p>The color themes of the major functional areas (Data, Data space, Modeling, Data Workflow, Data services, Administration) have been removed. The <strong>main</strong> and <strong>secondary</strong> colors are derived from the colors of the <strong>Data</strong> area in previous versions.</p><h4>
Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h4>
<p>As of version 5.4.0, in order to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, HTML code that is included in master data is systematically escaped, and the tags appear as plain-text in all views. This change does not impact data model and workflow model labels and description.</p><h3>
<a name="id10s2"></a>How to upgrade an installed environment</h3>
<p>In order to upgrade your version of EBX5, perform the following steps:</p><ol>
<li><p>Backup your repository, including the RDBMS and the directory <code>ebx.repository.directory</code>.</p></li><li><p>Replace the <code>*.war</code> and <code>ebx.jar</code> files on your application server.</p></li></ol>
<fieldset class="ebx_attention">
<legend>
<b>Attention</b></legend>
<p>If using EBX5 add-ons, ensure that the versions of the add-ons are compatible with EBX5 version 5.4.0 before upgrading. For the backward compatibility of the add-ons themselves, consult the release note of each add-on.</p><p>Once an EBX5 repository has been used with this version, using it with a previous version is not supported. Consequently, you must create a back up before upgrading, as described above, in order to maintain the possibility of downgrading later.</p><p>Upon installation of this new version, a DDL for product upgrade will be executed, which creates a new index on the table <code>{ebx.persistence.table.prefix}HTB</code>. On larger repositories, this may introduce a one-time performance hit when starting the server for the upgrade (about one minute for 20M records in the <code>{ebx.persistence.table.prefix}HTB</code> table). </p></fieldset>
